Today is a beautiful day
so we'll be seeing a few commands 
1. git status ---- shows the status of the files
2. git add --- adds the file to stage area
3. git commit --- commits the file with a message (-m)
4. git push origin main --- pushes the commited file to the origin in the main branch
5. git pull origin main --- pulls(updates) the files edited in the origin and main branch

In today's lecture I got to learn how to push and pull files to and from my repository.
I also learned about markup language , where it is used, how it is different from html.
